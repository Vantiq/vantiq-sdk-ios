 The execute method executes a procedure on the Vantiq server. Procedures can take parameters (i.e. arguments) and produce a result.
 
 @warning Please also note this method invokes a callback block associated with a network-
 related block. Because this block is called from asynchronous network operations,
 its code must be wrapped by a call to _dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^ {...});_
 to ensure UI operations are completed on the main thread.
 
 It is important to check the response and error callback return values to verify there were no
 errors returned by the execute operation. The callback data returns the results of the procedure, if any.

 @param  procedure    The procedure to execute. The parameters may be provided as an array where the arguments are given in order. Alternatively, the parameters may be provided as an object where the arguments are named.
